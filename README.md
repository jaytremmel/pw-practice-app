This is my personal Playwright sandbox. It's a persistent toolbelt I use for exploring, testing, and refining automation workflows. It's not meant for production use. It‚Äôs an iterative space where I build out commonly used selectors, reusable functions, and test patterns across a variety of components and UI states.

## üì¶ Current Project State

Right now, this repo is focused on a single test case as I set up and validate the CI pipeline.  
This phase is about reliability and integration, not coverage.

- ‚úÖ CI Pipeline: In progress
- ‚úÖ PR Gatekeeping: Configured
  - Pull requests are now automatically validated against this test.
  - Failures block the PR from merging.
- üñºÔ∏è Screenshot Testing: Argo CI integration enabled

## üõ£Ô∏è Next Steps

- Expand test coverage across the full suite
- Fix passing badge from manual - add playwright.yml to project
- Build utility wrappers for more advanced selectors
- Add environment toggles for dev/staging/prod test targets
- Tighten reporting and alerting on visual regressions

## ü§ù Why This Exists

Sometimes you just need your own playground and a space to move fast, break things, iterate without red tape.  
This is mine.

Go Bills!!
